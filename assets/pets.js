    about:
      "Luna is a majestic Maine Coon with a fluffy grey coat and striking white markings. She was found as a stray and has since become a gentle and affectionate companion. Luna enjoys perching on windowsills, watching birds, and being the center of attention. She's a bit shy at first but warms up quickly, especially if you have treats! Luna would thrive in a calm environment where she can relax and be pampered like the queen she is.",
