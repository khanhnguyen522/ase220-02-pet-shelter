### Project Structure:

Our project consists of a main page (MainPage.html) and detailed pages for individual pets. During our discussion with professor Caporusso, he advised us to create detailed pages for only three pets. As a result, we have created Baxter.html, Luna.html, and Sandy.html as detailed pages for the first three pets. For the remaining seven pets, we have implemented a navigation system where the links lead to the detailed page of Baxter.html.
